        <p>
            For the first part of this project, I implemented mirror and glass surfaces by calculating the appropriate
            reflection, refraction, and sampling for each material. For the second part, I implemented sampling and
            reflection for the microfacet surface. One of the most difficult aspects of this project was implementing
            the sampling functions since it was crucial to keep track of exactly which vectors corresponded to which
            direction and how to appropriately implement the sign and order of the reflections. One bug that I
            had for a while was that in the microfacet case, I was reflecting the wrong vectors across each other
            (rather than reflecting w0 according to h, I had accidentally done h according to w0) and this was giving
            me an almost completely black object which was hard to debug. Otherwise, I thought this project was really
            cool in showing how different forms of reflection and refraction could create such stunning and realistic
            looking images! The glass sphere in particular was very cool to implement and see the internal refraction
            displayed with increasing bounce depths.

        <br />
        <b>Multibounce effects for each bounce number</b>
        <br />
        <p>Max depth 0: In this scenario, since the max depth is 0, only direct lighting shows up since we
        do not allow any bounce reflections of the light upon any surface. As a result, only the ceiling light is a
        light emitting object so it is the only source and presence of light in the image.</p>
        <p>Max depth 1: For a max depth of 1, we allow one bounce of light. This means that the ceiling light
        is able to bounce once and display the colors of the walls and box floor. For the two spheres, a single bounce
        of light is not enough to illuminate the surfaces so only the parts of the spheres that directly reflect the
        ceiling light are shown. These regions are the two white (glare) spots on the spheres since those are the
        only regions that directly reflect the ceiling light and do not require any internal or wall-reflected bouncing to display the surface color.</p>
        <p>Max depth 2: With 2 bounces, the lens is able to receive light that has bounced off of the surface of the walls
        into the object. As a result, we can see that the mirror
        sphere displays reflections of the walls now, because these colors shown are achieved by light bouncing once off
        of the walls and once from the sphere and into the lens. For the glass sphere, since a smaller fraction of the
        light bounces off the surface (since some of it goes into the surface through refraction), we can see a much
        fainter reflection in the sphere which is mostly black (due to lack of internal light bounces) but still
        depicting the faint light reflective bounces from the light rays that hit the walls and then hit the
        glass sphere and returned to the lens. Finally, after two bounces of light, we have also lighted up the ceiling
        so the ceiling is no longer black.</p>
        <p>Max depth 3: In max depth 3, now we have an extra bounce that allows internal bounces in the glass sphere
        to reach the lens. These internal bounces show the refraction of light from the box walls into the sphere
        and require 3 bounces for hitting the wall, then hitting the sphere, then hitting the inner part of the sphere,
        and finally bouncing toward the lens. It is clear in this image that the glass object is able to now display
        both the reflected and refracted light on its surface. Fo the mirror sphere, we can also see some new changes
        as a result of the extra bounce which allows the mirror to reflect the ceiling surface (since the mirrorr was only just
            lit up previously after 2 bounces). </p>
        <p>Max depth 4: With the fourth bounce, the image is now looking very close to a realistic lighting image.
        The main changes in this section are that the internal lighting of the glass is now able to reflect an extra
        bounce of light onto other surfaces so we can see that the mirror sphere now accurately displays a reflection
        of the glass sphere (whereas in the previous frame, it was still mostly black from the lack of internal light
        refraction). Similarly, we can see a spot of light in the right wall by the glass sphere which is caused by
        the refracted and reflected glare on the sphere being pinpointed out toward the wall. Additionally, we can see
        that the previous shading in the bottom of the glass sphere caused by the original lack of direct ceiling light
        is now appropriately reflecting light to accurately represent the glass surface's clear nature.</p>
        <p>Max depth 5: Beginning with the 5th depth, there are not very many noticeable changes. The only clear difference
        which can be seen by overlaying the two images and switching back and forth quickly is the scene being a bit brighter
        due to the extra light reflecting and bouncing around the box. However, there are no major lighting or shading
        differences and only a slight barely noticeable modification in the white glare points of the mirror sphere's
        reflection of the glass sphere to represent the updated distribution of light refraction in the glass from the
        previous depth level.</p>
        <p>Max depth 100: Between depth 5 and depth 100, no significant change occurs besides the brightening of the room
        due to a couple more light bounces. In the images displayed above, the difference might not be very clear but
        the general brightening of the entire room along with a slightly brighter glass sphere and a very slightly more
        pronounced glare in the reflection of the glass sphere within the mirror surface are the only changes after
        95 more allowed bounces.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>As we increase alpha, we can see that the surface material changes and appears less smooth and reflective.
            The smallest alpha of 0.005 has a very glossy texture and strongly reflects the wall colors in a manner
            very similar to the mirror surface (but with a slight yellow hue due to the gold material). As the alpha value
            increases, we can see that the reflection becomes less and less prominent and instead is replaced with a much
            stronger yellow surface texture such that the highest alpha barely has any wall color reflection and has a
            prominently dull matte gold appearance.

                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="images/bunny_cosh.png" align="middle" width="400px" />

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>Comparing the two results, we can see that the importance sampling case has a much smoother and well-rendered
        lighting of the bunny surface while the cosine hemisphere displays a very noisy image with many poorly-rendered black
            regions. This is because the importance sampling is able to more effectively sample
        and set the appropriate pdf for each sampled light ray according to the microfaceted texture, whereas the original
        given implementation only samples uniformly without taking into consideration the alpha, eta, and k of the
            textured surface.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>I used different eta and k values found online to make a gold and aluminum bunny. We can see that the
        gold bunny has a much stronger yellow RGB reflection to create the prominent gold hue while the aluminum
        has a very shiny gray silver appearance.</p>
